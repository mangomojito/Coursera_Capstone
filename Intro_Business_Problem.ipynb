    "# Like most things in life, driving a vehicle carries a certain level of risk which depends on a wide range of various\n",
    "# factors. In 2018, there were approximately 33,654 fatal car accidents within the US that resulted in the deaths of\n",
    "# 36,560 individuals. If there were a reliable way to predict the safety levels of various driving conditions, then it\n",
    "# could result in a significant reduction in car accidents and the resulting fatalities. Clearly, this is a pressing\n",
    "# issue considering accidents are one of the leading causes of death and injury in our country.\n",

    "# This project aims to determine what the most influential factors are that contribute to the severity of a motor\n",
    "# vehicle accident, such as weather conditions, road conditions, light conditions, etc. and then create a model that\n",
    "# will be able to predict the severity of an accident based on these factors.\n"
